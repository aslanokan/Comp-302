# Vision
Bricking Bad Game is a brick breaking game that encourages user to extend the current mode of game playing by allowing them to create their own maps, make use of sophisticated powerups and interact with different agents. In the game, the player can surpass the usual Brick Breaking games by being able to rotate their paddle. The aliens add a challenge to the game by repairing or protecting bricks. The game even employs the duality of life with the existence of cooperative aliens who help the player but may also be offended by the hostile and ambitious fires of the player. Bricking Bad is not only a game but a lifestyle.
